# Tracking-Location

I had implemented the project tracing location using mobile number with python 
programming language which accepts a mobile number as an input, tracks the location 
and displays the information like country name, along with latitude, longitude and the 
network service provider to the user. This application is very simple and can be easily understand which requires only phone number to reach all our requirements in this 
application.
